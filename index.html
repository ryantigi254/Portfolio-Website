    <div class="about-me-full">
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Ryan, a first-year AI and Data Science student at the University of Northampton. I've always been interested in tech, but it wasn't until I stumbled upon AI that I truly found my passion. There's something incredibly exciting about the potential of AI to reshape our world, and make our lives easier and more efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away on my latest projects, I'm usually trying out my own mini AI experiments. I love how AI challenges us to think differently about intelligence, creativity, and what it means to be human.

                <p>
                    I'm fascinated by the more speculative, almost sci-fi aspects of AI. Some of the mind-bending concepts that keep me up at night include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The possibility of machine sentience - could AI one day truly be conscious?</li>
                    <li>The potential for superintelligence - what happens when AI surpasses human intelligence in every way?</li>
                    <li>The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - can we create AI that's as versatile as the human mind?</li>
                    <li>The implications of technological singularity - how might society change if AI progress becomes exponential?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These ideas might sound like science fiction, but they're increasingly becoming topics of serious academic and ethical debate and research. They're what drive my passion for AI and keep me eager to learn more every day.

                <span class="short-description">Spearheading AI literacy research and development in higher education.</span>
                <div class="expandable-content">
                    <p>As a key member of the Study Smart project, funded by the UON Learning Enhancement and Innovation Fund, I'm deeply involved in groundbreaking research on AI applications in education. Our focus is on enhancing independent learning and revision among students through innovative AI-driven solutions.</p>
                    <p>My role involves conducting in-depth research, data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using tools like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. This work is crucial in identifying trends that contribute to current and future educational strategies within the university.</p>
                    <p>A significant part of my work centers on AI literacy enhancement. I deliver comprehensive workshops and presentations to both faculty and students, facilitating effective knowledge sharing about AI in education. Our project's impact was recognized when we presented at three conferences, highlighting our outstanding contribution to AI in education.</p>
                    <p>I'm also heavily involved in the technical aspects of our research, including prompt engineering and fine-tuning a customized GPT model. Through data analysis and output testing, I ensure accurate and desired results, leveraging my expertise in AI and machine learning.</p>
                    <p>Most recently, I co-authored and presented our research, "Study Smart: Staff and students co-constructing AI literacy at UON," at the Merged Futures 6 conference on June 14, 2024. This county-level presentation showcased our team's collaborative efforts in advancing AI literacy within our academic community.</p>
