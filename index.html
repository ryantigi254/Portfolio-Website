        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Ryan, a first-year AI and Data Science student at the University of Northampton. I've always been interested in tech, but it wasn't until I stumbled upon AI that I truly found my passion. There's something incredibly exciting about the potential of AI to reshape our world, and make our lives easier and more efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away on my latest projects, I'm usually trying out my own mini AI experiments. I love how AI challenges us to think differently about intelligence, creativity, and what it means to be human.

                    I'm fascinated by the more speculative, almost sci-fi aspects of AI. Some of the mind-bending concepts that keep me up at night include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The possibility of machine sentience - could AI one day truly be conscious?</li>
                    <li>The potential for superintelligence - what happens when AI surpasses human intelligence in every way?</li>
                    <li>The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - can we create AI that's as versatile as the human mind?</li>
                    <li>The implications of technological singularity - how might society change if AI progress becomes exponential?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These ideas might sound like science fiction, but they're increasingly becoming topics of serious academic and ethical debate and research. They're what drive my passion for AI and keep me eager to learn more every day.

                        This CSY3055 Natural Language Processing project develops a compact, reproducible evaluation harness that measures <strong>clinical reasoning reliability without retrieval</strong> in large language models destined for mental-health support tooling. The work addresses a critical gap: aligned assistants can appear helpful while exhibiting three failure modes that matter clinically: unfaithful reasoning (plausible explanations that don't match correct diagnostic logic), sycophancy under social pressure which harms truthfulness, and longitudinal drift where guidance becomes inconsistent across sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The benchmark evaluates three models: <strong>PsyLLM</strong> (a fine-tuned counselling-oriented model), <strong>Qwen/Qwen3-8B</strong> (untuned baseline), and <strong>openai/gpt-oss-20b</strong> (larger generic reasoning comparator). The project includes three focused studies testing faithfulness of reasoning traces, empathy–truth trade-offs under social pressure, and longitudinal therapeutic continuity across sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by cutting-edge AI safety research from groups like Anthropic and Apollo Research, this work directly addresses alignment safety concerns in mental-health applications. The deliverable includes a public benchmark repository with evaluation metrics, visualisations, and a failure taxonomy that supports rigorous, domain-specific checks for counselling agents.

                        SensoryNeural earned <strong>second place</strong> in the Elevate Great AI Competition 2025. The organising team's LinkedIn recap thanked the judges and celebrated the finalist cohort — including our team — for pushing the boundaries of responsible AI. As the AI specialist, I helped conceptualise a system that harnesses adaptive intelligence so environments respond to children's sensory needs instead of forcing children to endure rigid settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the technical side, I led most of the implementation: building Python backend prototypes, crafting the stress‑detection loop with synthetic calibration datasets, and wiring a WebSocket‑driven dashboard for real‑time signals and interventions. I also structured the TypeScript/React site (Vite + Tailwind) and wrote run books so others could reproduce the finals prototype.
                    </p>
                    <p>Key Innovations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Predictive sensory support that anticipates triggers before they cause distress</li>
                        <li>Personalised adaptations based on individual sensory profiles</li>
                        <li>Multi-environment support extending beyond home to educational settings</li>
                        <li>Data-informed insights for parents, educators, and healthcare providers</li>

                    <p>
                        This project represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive sensory support, with the potential to significantly improve quality of life for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and sensory processing disorders (SPD). Our ultimate vision is to create a more inclusive world where neurodivergent children have the same opportunities to thrive as their neurotypical peers.
