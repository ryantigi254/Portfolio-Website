Hi everyone!

Over the past few years, I’ve been reflecting on a challenge many students face when starting university: choosing the right course of study. This is especially important in today’s world, where artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at an incredible pace, reshaping industries and the future of work. The decisions we make about our education today will have long-lasting impacts on our careers, particularly with AI becoming increasingly embedded in almost every field.

When I first started my foundation year, I quickly noticed a trend among my peers—many of them chose broad courses like computer science, mostly because it was perceived as offering more options down the road. But after two years of listening to tech podcasts, engaging with AI thought leaders, and digging deeper into this subject, I’ve come to realise that this choice, though practical on the surface, may not always be the best approach.

**Why the Traditional Approach Might Not Work in the Age of AI**

Let me explain. 

University is often seen as a place to explore, discover new interests, and figure out what we want to specialise in by the time we graduate. This makes sense for many people. However, as AI continues to advance, I believe it’s becoming increasingly important to be more intentional from the start. 

Here’s why: AI is reshaping industries like web development, cybersecurity, healthcare, and even neuroscience. Instead of picking a broad course like “computer science” and hoping to figure it out along the way, it’s better to choose a more specific field early on—whether that’s AI, computer networking, or another niche area. With AI evolving so quickly, the way you learn and adapt to its integration into your chosen field will be key to staying relevant.

This is a thought that has been echoed by many professionals in the AI and tech space. Through listening to numerous podcasts, I’ve heard CEOs and researchers like **Sam Altman**, **Dario Amodei**, **Jensen Huang**, and **Leopold Aschenbrenner** stress the importance of adaptability, creativity, and emotional intelligence. They encourage students to master the tools at their disposal and remain flexible in their learning as the world changes around them. For instance, **Jensen Huang**, CEO of Nvidia, talks about the power of *digital biology*, and **Dario Amodei** (CEO of Anthropic) explores the idea that AI will not just analyse data but also start directing research itself. This suggests that simply learning to code or studying AI in isolation isn’t enough. We need to integrate AI with other fields like **bioinformatics**, **genetics**, and **neuroscience** to fully harness its potential.

**Navigating a New Learning Landscape**

Of course, these kinds of insights can be hard to decipher. After all, these are not topics that you can just “learn” in a traditional school setting. They require self-study, curiosity, and a willingness to dive into cutting-edge areas of research and technology. **Sam Altman** often talks about the importance of anticipating AI’s continual improvement, and this has shaped the way I approach learning and career advice for myself and others. Instead of waiting until graduation to figure out where your passion lies, it makes more sense to start with a specific interest—even if it’s not fully formed—and evolve it over time.

That brings me to the project I’ve been working on.

**A Project to Guide Your Course Selection in the Age of AI**

I’m developing a solution aimed at helping students and professionals make more informed, future-proof decisions about their education. It’s designed to guide users through the process of selecting a course of study based on current AI advancements, scaling laws, and reasoning breakthroughs. The idea is to help people align their passions with future-forward fields that will remain relevant as AI systems continue to grow more capable.

Think about fields like AI in **Mars research**, **interstellar travel**, **neurobiology**, and even **superintelligence** research. These are not only exciting areas to study, but they’re also fields with long-term potential as we move toward more advanced AI systems. The goal of my project is to provide a framework that maps out these courses and helps students discover how they can best prepare for a future where AI is at the forefront of nearly every industry.

By using this tool, students can map out potential courses and areas of study that will set them up for success in an AI-driven future. I believe that by choosing something futuristic and specific—whether that’s AI in space exploration or studying sentient AI—you can stay ahead of the curve and build a career that remains indispensable as AI continues to evolve.

**What’s Next in This Series**

This post is just the beginning of a series where I’ll dive deeper into how to approach course selection in this AI-driven world. In the next posts, I’ll break down more of what I’ve learned from AI experts like **Sam Altman**, **Dario Amodei**, and others, and I’ll explore the tools and traits needed to thrive in the future. At the end of the series, I’ll introduce the solution I’m developing, which will guide students and professionals in choosing the right path for their careers in this rapidly changing landscape.

So, expect to see the first rough solution in the next week or two. I’m excited to share this journey with you, and I hope this series can provide some clarity in navigating the complex world of education and career choices in the age of AI.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts, and stay tuned for more updates!

Cheers,  
Ryan
