In a world where AI is rapidly advancing, how should someone choose their course of study? Sam Altman mentioned that if you build a business assuming AI systems will remain as they are, you'll lose. But if you build a business assuming AI systems will get better, then you'll win. We know for sure that AI will improve due to scaling laws, reasoning breakthroughs, etc. What would your framework be?
For me, it would be to choose something specific and futuristic, like AI implementation in Mars research, interstellar travel, neurobiology, the study of wormholes, sentient AI, or research into superintelligence—similar to how Ilya started a company to pursue superintelligence (SSI). These are all bets that, even if I study them for 3-4 years, will still be relevant or become key research efforts as we develop more capable systems.Initially, I assumed the project strawberry account was part of a clever product launch marketing for GPT-5, AI agents, or something even bigger from OpenAI. Now, it seems to be more of a campaign to drive awareness toward the growing need for proof of personhood and AI-funded UBI via Worldcoin, which was co-founded by Sam Altman. Think about it. In July, Altman shared the results of the UBI study from OpenResearch. He posted a photo of strawberries in his garden, which many considered confirmation that 
@iruletheworldmo
 was somehow linked to OpenAI. Amongst the hype, the has engaged with several influential people to further promote the growing need for UBI before AGI gives AI agents and humanoid robots the ability to take over more jobs. Now, OpenAI has published research on the growing need for personhood credentials. Worldcoin, of course, is one of the largest PHC systems with six-million users. Altman also described Worldcoin as "a new cryptocurrency that will be distributed fairly to as many people as possible." In other words, AI-funded UBI that could be distributed through the World App to human-verified World ID holders.You've outlined a fascinating theory about the potential connections between the @iruletheworldmo Twitter account, OpenAI's recent activities, and Sam Altman's involvement with Worldcoin. Let's break this down:

The UBI Study: In July, OpenResearch (backed by Sam Altman) released results from a major Universal Basic Income study, highlighting potential benefits and impacts.
The Strawberry Connection: Altman posted a photo of strawberries from his garden, which some interpreted as a nod to the @iruletheworldmo account (known as "Strawberry man").
Personhood Credentials Research: OpenAI recently published research on the need for "personhood credentials" to distinguish humans from AI online.
Worldcoin's Growth: Worldcoin, co-founded by Altman, has reached 6 million users and aims to provide a global identity and financial network.
AI-Funded UBI Concept: Worldcoin has been positioned as a potential vehicle for distributing AI-generated wealth widely.

This theory suggests a coordinated effort to:

Raise awareness about the need for UBI in light of potential AI-driven job displacement
Promote the concept of personhood verification as AI becomes more advanced
Position Worldcoin as a solution for both identity verification and UBI distribution

While this is an intriguing theory, it's important to note:

There's no official confirmation of links between @iruletheworldmo and OpenAI/Altman.
The timing could be coincidental, given ongoing discussions about AI's impact on society.
Altman and OpenAI have been openly discussing these topics for some time.

However, if true, it would represent a sophisticated campaign to shape public discourse around AI, UBI, and digital identity. It highlights the complex intersections between AI development, economic policy, and digital infrastructure.
This situation underscores the importance of:

Critical thinking about information sources and potential agendas
Open discussions about AI's societal impacts
Careful consideration of proposals for digital identity and economic systems

As AI continues to advance, these discussions will likely become even more crucial for shaping our technological and economic future.

Here’s a draft of a mini blog post you can use to tease your current project:

Exciting Project in the Works: Stay Tuned!

Hey everyone!

As AI continues to evolve at a breakneck pace, the way we approach learning and work must keep up. Inspired by visionaries like Sam Altman, who remind us that building with the assumption that AI will only get better is the key to success, I’ve embarked on a new project. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be working on a rough solution that applies AI in a unique and futuristic way, aligning with my goal of building skills that will remain relevant for years to come.

This project will explore some cutting-edge areas, like the intersection of AI and long-term research fields such as Mars exploration, interstellar travel, and sentient AI. It’s my take on tackling the kind of projects that will stay crucial as AI continues to scale and improve, much like the research into superintelligence (SSI) initiated by experts in the field.

Without giving too much away, this project will involve a creative AI-based solution to a very real challenge we face today. Think of it as a framework that might help you choose a path in your studies or career, with a futuristic edge. I’m aiming to release the first version in the next week or two, so stay tuned!

Worldcoin's Growth: Worldcoin, co-founded by Altman, has reached 6 million users and aims to provide a global identity and financial network.
AI-Funded UBI Concept: Worldcoin has been positioned as a potential vehicle for distributing AI-generated wealth widely.

This theory suggests a coordinated effort to:

Raise awareness about the need for UBI in light of potential AI-driven job displacement
Promote the concept of personhood verification as AI becomes more advanced
Position Worldcoin as a solution for both identity verification and UBI distribution

While this is an intriguing theory, it's important to note:

There's no official confirmation of links between @iruletheworldmo and OpenAI/Altman.
The timing could be coincidental, given ongoing discussions about AI's impact on society.
Altman and OpenAI have been openly discussing these topics for some time.

**Choosing the Right Course of Study in an AI-Driven World: My Latest Project**

Hi everyone!

As we find ourselves in a world where AI is advancing at lightning speed, the challenge of choosing the right course of study becomes more crucial than ever. Inspired by Sam Altman’s perspective that building for the future of AI means anticipating its continued improvement, I’ve been working on a project aimed at helping individuals make future-proof decisions about their education and careers.

Personally, I've noticed a common theme from listening to numerous podcasts featuring CEOs of AI companies, top AI researchers, and industry leaders. They frequently emphasize the importance of becoming familiar with the tools, being adaptable, exploring fields like digital biology (as Jensen Huang mentions), and leveraging creativity. However, while their advice is valuable, it can sometimes be hard to decipher, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific course of study that aligns with these evolving demands.

That’s where my project comes in. I'm developing a solution that guides users through the process of choosing a course of study based on these insights and AI advancements, scaling laws, and reasoning breakthroughs. It’s a tool designed to help people align their interests with forward-thinking fields that will remain relevant as AI systems become more sophisticated. Think AI in Mars research, interstellar travel, neurobiology, and even superintelligence research. These are fields that are not only exciting but also have long-term potential as we build more capable AI systems.

By using this tool, users will be able to map out courses and areas of study that will set them up for success in an AI-driven future. I believe that by choosing something futuristic and specific, like AI in space exploration or sentient AI research, we can stay ahead of the curve and build careers that remain indispensable as AI evolves.

Expect to see a rough solution in the next week or two, and I can't wait to share this with you! Stay tuned for more updates, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this exciting journey.

Cheers,

However, while their advice is valuable, it can sometimes be hard to decipher, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific course of study that aligns with these evolving demands.

With a few of them being a bit more direct, like Dario Amodei's recent blog post (Machines of Loving Grace), there’s often a focus on the interdisciplinary nature of AI, particularly in areas like biology, neuroscience, and economics. Dario talks about how AI will not only analyze data but eventually design experiments and direct research. This suggests that learning AI alone isn't enough; you need to integrate it into broader fields like genetic research, bioinformatics, and neuroscience to truly unlock its potential.

And indeed, these are topics I still find hard to decipher, because it's not something you can learn in a typical school setting. Most of these areas require intent, self-study, and a drive to integrate AI into futuristic fields. Sam Altman often talks about the importance of staying ahead by assuming AI will continually improve, and this forms the core of my project.

That’s where my project comes in.

I usually share this line of thinking with my friends and family, but it is becoming more common. I noticed this just before I started my foundation year and have been identifying this over and over again in the past 2 years of my university. 

What exactly I’m I saying, during this time I noted that majority of people at least from my perspective result to a computer science course and most of them who I spoke with stated that it provides them with more options later on.

After lots of thinking, learning, listening to podcasts in and around tech and AI I have noted that this choice is indeed poor and not appropriate for most people. I know university is meant for discovering what we like trying out new things and eventually by graduation have something in mind that we would like to specialise in then pursue it as work or masters or phd. However with AI in the picture now and identifying that it’s here to stay, I aligned more with choosing a specific interest at start e.g: web development, cybersecurity, computer networking, AI, etc there so many field you can go into in computer science and so are other fields but with ai in the picture it’s better to start thinking of a course or method of learning the course or material as well as the ai impact and how you can adapt and learn. 

With this in mind I usually advice people to pick a specific interest, even if it’s rough and start that as their coruse with time as you get your interest you can adapt. And adapts is one of the key traits Sam Altman iterates and restates in multiple podcasts that students should be creative, have emotional intelligence, adapt quickly, learn how to use the tools to aid us etc. this traits can be learnt in any course however I never heard any particular course suggested to students.

Here’s a draft of the first blog post in the series, introducing your line of thinking and leading into the more detailed future posts:

Why Choosing the Right Course from the Start Matters in the Age of AI

When I started my foundation year, I began noticing a common trend among students. More often than not, when it came to choosing a course, many people gravitated toward computer science, often stating that it "provides more options later on." Over the past two years of university, I’ve had more conversations on this topic with friends and family, and I’ve come to realise that this approach might not be the best fit for everyone. In fact, it might even be a poor choice in some cases.

While university is a time to explore different subjects and eventually figure out what you want to specialise in by graduation, things have changed. With the rapid rise of AI, and the fact that it’s here to stay, I believe it’s becoming even more important to make more intentional decisions when choosing your initial course.

Let me explain.

AI is reshaping industries, from web development and cybersecurity to fields like healthcare and neuroscience. It’s becoming clearer that instead of sticking with broad, general courses like “computer science,” it might be smarter to pick a specific area of interest from the beginning—whether that’s AI, computer networking, web development, or any other tech field. With AI’s ever-growing influence, it’s important to think not only about the subject you’re studying but also about how AI will impact it and how you can adapt and grow alongside it.

This line of thinking has been echoed by many leading voices in AI and tech. I’ve spent a lot of time listening to podcasts and talks by experts like Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) and Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic), and they all reinforce the same point: being adaptable, creative, and emotionally intelligent is crucial. These traits can be nurtured in any course, but what I’ve found missing is specific guidance for students. Nobody says exactly what courses to take.

So, my advice to those just starting out is to choose a specific interest, even if it’s rough around the edges, and dive into that field. With time, your interests may evolve, and that’s okay! The key is to start somewhere that excites you, because adapting is a skill you’ll need no matter where you end up. And, as Sam Altman often repeats, learning how to use the tools available to us, from AI to creative problem-solving, is vital for success in the future.

This is the start of a series of posts where I’ll dive deeper into these ideas—how we should approach course selection in this AI-driven world and how to prepare for a future where AI plays a central role. In the next post, I’ll get into the nitty-gritty details and share more of what I’ve learned from my own experience and from industry leaders.

Stay tuned, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

With AI’s ever-growing influence, it’s important to think not only about the subject you’re studying but also about how AI will impact it and how you can adapt and grow alongside it.

Over the past few years, I've gained a lot of insights from podcasts and blogs by top professionals in the AI space. Experts like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Leopold Aschenbrenner, and others, frequently emphasize how critical it is to become adaptable, learn how to use the tools available, and be creative in our approach to learning and working with AI. These professionals often talk about the importance of emotional intelligence and quickly adapting to new trends in technology. For example, Dario Amodei stresses the need to integrate AI into broader fields like biology and neuroscience, which will be pivotal in the future of scientific discovery.

And sure, while all this advice is incredibly valuable, I understand that it can sometimes be hard to decipher. After all, you can’t just pick up emotional intelligence or adaptability in a standard classroom setting. It’s something that grows with experience, intent, and the willingness to push yourself outside your comfort zone.

That’s why I advise people to pick a specific interest, even if it’s still a bit rough, and start exploring that as their core area of study. With time, you’ll find what truly resonates with you, and you can adapt along the way. As Sam Altman repeatedly says, being adaptable is key, and this adaptability will serve you well as you face the AI-driven changes in the world around us. Plus, the journey to finding your passion becomes smoother when you start with something that excites you, instead of waiting until graduation to figure it out.

So, my thoughts may just be a series of insights gathered from experts—and sure, there’s a chance I might be a bit biased here—but in this age of AI, it’s worth considering whether the traditional path of picking a broad, general course still makes sense. Why not make a choice that aligns more with the future?

Here’s a more comprehensive and polished version of the blog post for Medium, introducing the series and your project while setting a smooth, thoughtful tone:

Choosing the Right Course of Study in an AI-Driven World: Why It Matters Now More Than Ever

Hi everyone!

Over the past few years, I’ve been reflecting on a challenge many students face when starting university: choosing the right course of study. This is especially important in today’s world, where artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at an incredible pace, reshaping industries and the future of work. The decisions we make about our education today will have long-lasting impacts on our careers, particularly with AI becoming increasingly embedded in almost every field.

When I first started my foundation year, I quickly noticed a trend among my peers—many of them chose broad courses like computer science, mostly because it was perceived as offering more options down the road. But after two years of listening to tech podcasts, engaging with AI thought leaders, and digging deeper into this subject, I’ve come to realise that this choice, though practical on the surface, may not always be the best approach.

Why the Traditional Approach Might Not Work in the Age of AI

Let me explain.

University is often seen as a place to explore, discover new interests, and figure out what we want to specialise in by the time we graduate. This makes sense for many people. However, as AI continues to advance, I believe it’s becoming increasingly important to be more intentional from the start.

Here’s why: AI is reshaping industries like web development, cybersecurity, healthcare, and even neuroscience. Instead of picking a broad course like “computer science” and hoping to figure it out along the way, it’s better to choose a more specific field early on—whether that’s AI, computer networking, or another niche area. With AI evolving so quickly, the way you learn and adapt to its integration into your chosen field will be key to staying relevant.

This is a thought that has been echoed by many professionals in the AI and tech space. Through listening to numerous podcasts, I’ve heard CEOs and researchers like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, and Leopold Aschenbrenner stress the importance of adaptability, creativity, and emotional intelligence. They encourage students to master the tools at their disposal and remain flexible in their learning as the world changes around them. For instance, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, talks about the power of digital biology, and Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic) explores the idea that AI will not just analyse data but also start directing research itself. This suggests that simply learning to code or studying AI in isolation isn’t enough. We need to integrate AI with other fields like bioinformatics, genetics, and neuroscience to fully harness its potential.

Navigating a New Learning Landscape

Of course, these kinds of insights can be hard to decipher. After all, these are not topics that you can just “learn” in a traditional school setting. They require self-study, curiosity, and a willingness to dive into cutting-edge areas of research and technology. Sam Altman often talks about the importance of anticipating AI’s continual improvement, and this has shaped the way I approach learning and career advice for myself and others. Instead of waiting until graduation to figure out where your passion lies, it makes more sense to start with a specific interest—even if it’s not fully formed—and evolve it over time.

That brings me to the project I’ve been working on.

A Project to Guide Your Course Selection in the Age of AI

I’m developing a solution aimed at helping students and professionals make more informed, future-proof decisions about their education. It’s designed to guide users through the process of selecting a course of study based on current AI advancements, scaling laws, and reasoning breakthroughs. The idea is to help people align their passions with future-forward fields that will remain relevant as AI systems continue to grow more capable.

Think about fields like AI in Mars research, interstellar travel, neurobiology, and even superintelligence research. These are not only exciting areas to study, but they’re also fields with long-term potential as we move toward more advanced AI systems. The goal of my project is to provide a framework that maps out these courses and helps students discover how they can best prepare for a future where AI is at the forefront of nearly every industry.

By using this tool, students can map out potential courses and areas of study that will set them up for success in an AI-driven future. I believe that by choosing something futuristic and specific—whether that’s AI in space exploration or studying sentient AI—you can stay ahead of the curve and build a career that remains indispensable as AI continues to evolve.

What’s Next in This Series

This post is just the beginning of a series where I’ll dive deeper into how to approach course selection in this AI-driven world. In the next posts, I’ll break down more of what I’ve learned from AI experts like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and others, and I’ll explore the tools and traits needed to thrive in the future. At the end of the series, I’ll introduce the solution I’m developing, which will guide students and professionals in choosing the right path for their careers in this rapidly changing landscape.

So, expect to see the first rough solution in the next week or two. I’m excited to share this journey with you, and I hope this series can provide some clarity in navigating the complex world of education and career choices in the age of AI.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts, and stay tuned for more updates!

Why Choosing the Right Course from the Start Matters in the Age of AI

As students, we often hear that university is a time for exploration—a place to try out different subjects, figure out what we like, and then eventually choose something to specialise in. This was the mindset I encountered when I started my foundation year. The prevailing advice I heard from friends, family, and even some professors was to choose a broad field, like computer science, because it "provides more options later on."

It seemed like sound advice at the time. And for a lot of people, this route makes sense. After all, the idea of keeping your options open is appealing. But after having more in-depth conversations with peers, immersing myself in the world of AI and tech through podcasts, articles, and interviews, I started questioning this conventional wisdom. In fact, I began to realise that for most people, this approach might not be the most effective way to navigate the rapidly changing landscape we find ourselves in today.

Why the Traditional Approach Might Be a Missed Opportunity

University, traditionally, has been a place where you’re expected to try out different things, discover your passions, and then, by graduation, hopefully, have a clearer idea of what you want to pursue in your career. However, things have changed. AI has changed everything.

The rapid rise of AI—and its potential to reshape industries—means that waiting until the end of your university years to decide on a direction might leave you behind. The world is moving fast, and we need to move with it. It’s no longer just about picking a general field and hoping to narrow it down later. Instead, we need to think strategically, understanding that AI isn’t just a trend—it’s a fundamental shift in the way we work, learn, and live.

The impact of AI is already being felt across a wide range of industries, from web development and cybersecurity to healthcare and neuroscience. AI is transforming how problems are solved, how data is analysed, and how decisions are made. In short, AI is becoming a core element of almost every major field, and this is something we need to take seriously when choosing our courses of study.

The Importance of Intentionality

So, what does that mean for those of us navigating our educational journeys? It means that now, more than ever, we need to be intentional about the courses we choose and the fields we enter. Rather than relying on a broad and generalised course like computer science, it might be smarter to pick a more specific area of interest from the beginning—whether that’s AI, computer networking, web development, biotech, or any other focused field.

Why? Because AI’s influence will only grow, and the fields it impacts will evolve at a pace that could outstrip our ability to keep up if we’re not already dialed into a niche. By starting with a specific area of interest, we not only put ourselves in a position to become specialists but also allow ourselves the flexibility to adapt and evolve as AI continues to shape those fields. It’s not just about what you study, but how you learn and adapt alongside these advances.

Insights from AI and Tech Leaders: What the Experts Are Saying

Over the past two years, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to podcasts and reading blogs by top professionals in the AI and tech spaces. Leaders like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, and Leopold Aschenbrenner often speak about the importance of adaptability, creativity, and emotional intelligence. These traits are vital not just in traditional fields but in AI as well.

For instance, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, frequently emphasizes that being adaptable is one of the most important traits to have in a world that’s being fundamentally reshaped by AI. Similarly, Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, points out the critical need for AI integration into fields like biology and neuroscience, predicting that AI won’t just analyse data but will eventually design experiments and even direct researchers.

This integration is where we need to focus. It’s no longer enough to just be good at coding or have a deep understanding of AI algorithms. Instead, we need to think about how AI will reshape other fields, and how we can be at the forefront of that transformation. This means combining AI with other disciplines, like genetic research, neuroscience, or biotech, to create something new and innovative.

Learning Beyond the Classroom

And sure, while all this advice is incredibly valuable, I understand that it can sometimes be hard to decipher. After all, these aren’t skills or traits that are taught in a standard classroom setting. You don’t learn adaptability or emotional intelligence by sitting in a lecture hall. These are traits that develop through experience, through trial and error, and through pushing yourself outside your comfort zone.

But that’s where the magic happens.

If you start with a specific area of interest—even if it’s still a bit rough—you can begin to cultivate these traits. Over time, you’ll find what truly resonates with you, and you can adapt along the way. The key is to start somewhere that excites you, rather than waiting until graduation to figure it all out. By choosing something that sparks your curiosity, you’ll be more inclined to push through the challenges and evolve as the world changes around you.

What I’ve Learned from the Experts (and a Bit of Bias)

I know my thoughts may come across as a series of insights I’ve gathered from experts, and sure, I’m a bit biased—after all, this is a path that’s worked for me. But when I hear Sam Altman reiterate in almost every podcast that being adaptable is key, or Dario Amodei stressing the need to combine AI with interdisciplinary fields, it becomes clear that the way we approach education has to change.

Choosing a broad, general course like computer science might no longer be enough. Instead, we need to be intentional, focusing on future-proofing our careers by aligning ourselves with the fields that AI will inevitably touch. And honestly, there’s a lot of excitement in being at the forefront of something new and dynamic.

Moving Forward: How to Prepare for the Future

This post is the first in a series where I’ll dive deeper into the nuances of how to navigate this ever-evolving AI landscape.

Ultimately, the series will culminate in practical steps and solutions that can guide you in preparing for a future where AI plays a central role in almost every industry.

So, if you’re starting your university journey—or even if you’re mid-way through it—it’s worth taking a moment to rethink your approach. Are you being intentional in choosing a field that aligns with where the world is headed? Are you thinking about how AI will impact the subject you’re studying?

The world is changing, and we have the opportunity to change with it.
