Here’s an advanced, more comprehensive version of the second blog in the series, which dives deeper into the reasoning behind choosing the right course from the start in the age of AI:

**Why Choosing the Right Course from the Start Matters in the Age of AI**

As students, we often hear that university is a time for exploration—a place to try out different subjects, figure out what we like, and then eventually choose something to specialise in. This was the mindset I encountered when I started my foundation year. The prevailing advice I heard from friends, family, and even some professors was to choose a broad field, like computer science, because it "provides more options later on."

It seemed like sound advice at the time. And for a lot of people, this route makes sense. After all, the idea of keeping your options open is appealing. But after having more in-depth conversations with peers, immersing myself in the world of AI and tech through podcasts, articles, and interviews, I started questioning this conventional wisdom. In fact, I began to realise that for most people, this approach might not be the most effective way to navigate the rapidly changing landscape we find ourselves in today.

**Why the Traditional Approach Might Be a Missed Opportunity**

University, traditionally, has been a place where you’re expected to try out different things, discover your passions, and then, by graduation, hopefully, have a clearer idea of what you want to pursue in your career. However, things have changed. **AI has changed everything.**

The rapid rise of AI—and its potential to reshape industries—means that waiting until the end of your university years to decide on a direction might leave you behind. The world is moving fast, and we need to move with it. It’s no longer just about picking a general field and hoping to narrow it down later. Instead, we need to think strategically, understanding that **AI isn’t just a trend—it’s a fundamental shift in the way we work, learn, and live**.

The impact of AI is already being felt across a wide range of industries, from **web development and cybersecurity** to **healthcare and neuroscience**. AI is transforming how problems are solved, how data is analysed, and how decisions are made. In short, AI is becoming a core element of almost every major field, and this is something we need to take seriously when choosing our courses of study.

**The Importance of Intentionality**

So, what does that mean for those of us navigating our educational journeys? It means that now, more than ever, we need to be **intentional** about the courses we choose and the fields we enter. Rather than relying on a broad and generalised course like computer science, it might be smarter to pick a more **specific area of interest** from the beginning—whether that’s AI, **computer networking**, **web development**, **biotech**, or any other focused field.

Why? Because AI’s influence will only grow, and the fields it impacts will evolve at a pace that could outstrip our ability to keep up if we’re not already dialed into a niche. By starting with a specific area of interest, we not only put ourselves in a position to become specialists but also allow ourselves the flexibility to adapt and evolve as AI continues to shape those fields. It’s not just about what you study, but how you learn and adapt alongside these advances.

**Insights from AI and Tech Leaders: What the Experts Are Saying**

Over the past two years, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to podcasts and reading blogs by top professionals in the AI and tech spaces. Leaders like **Sam Altman**, **Dario Amodei**, **Jensen Huang**, and **Leopold Aschenbrenner** often speak about the importance of **adaptability**, **creativity**, and **emotional intelligence**. These traits are vital not just in traditional fields but in AI as well.

For instance, **Sam Altman**, CEO of OpenAI, frequently emphasizes that being adaptable is one of the most important traits to have in a world that’s being fundamentally reshaped by AI. Similarly, **Dario Amodei**, CEO of Anthropic, points out the critical need for AI integration into fields like **biology** and **neuroscience**, predicting that AI won’t just analyse data but will eventually design experiments and even direct researchers.

This integration is where we need to focus. It’s no longer enough to just be good at coding or have a deep understanding of AI algorithms. Instead, we need to think about **how AI will reshape other fields**, and how we can be at the forefront of that transformation. This means **combining AI with other disciplines**, like **genetic research**, **neuroscience**, or **biotech**, to create something new and innovative.

**Learning Beyond the Classroom**

And sure, while all this advice is incredibly valuable, I understand that it can sometimes be hard to decipher. After all, these aren’t skills or traits that are taught in a standard classroom setting. You don’t learn **adaptability** or **emotional intelligence** by sitting in a lecture hall. These are traits that develop through experience, through trial and error, and through pushing yourself outside your comfort zone.

But that’s where the magic happens.

If you start with a specific area of interest—even if it’s still a bit rough—you can begin to cultivate these traits. Over time, you’ll find what truly resonates with you, and you can **adapt** along the way. The key is to start somewhere that excites you, rather than waiting until graduation to figure it all out. By choosing something that sparks your curiosity, you’ll be more inclined to push through the challenges and evolve as the world changes around you.

**What I’ve Learned from the Experts (and a Bit of Bias)**

I know my thoughts may come across as a series of insights I’ve gathered from experts, and sure, I’m a bit biased—after all, this is a path that’s worked for me. But when I hear **Sam Altman** reiterate in almost every podcast that **being adaptable** is key, or **Dario Amodei** stressing the need to **combine AI with interdisciplinary fields**, it becomes clear that the way we approach education has to change. 

Choosing a broad, general course like computer science might no longer be enough. Instead, we need to be intentional, focusing on **future-proofing our careers** by aligning ourselves with the fields that AI will inevitably touch. And honestly, there’s a lot of excitement in being at the forefront of something new and dynamic.

**Moving Forward: How to Prepare for the Future**

This post is the first in a series where I’ll dive deeper into the nuances of how to navigate this ever-evolving AI landscape. In the next posts, I’ll go further into the details of how to choose a specific area of study, what tools and skills you should focus on, and how to build adaptability into your learning process. Ultimately, the series will culminate in practical steps and solutions that can guide you in preparing for a future where AI plays a central role in almost every industry.

So, if you’re starting your university journey—or even if you’re mid-way through it—it’s worth taking a moment to rethink your approach. Are you being intentional in choosing a field that aligns with where the world is headed? Are you thinking about how AI will impact the subject you’re studying? 

The world is changing, and we have the opportunity to change with it.

Stay tuned for the next post in this series, where we’ll dive deeper into these ideas and begin exploring the steps you can take to future-proof your education and career. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Cheers,
