    <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Ryan, a 1st year AI and Data Science student at the University of Northampton. My interest in artificial intelligence comes from its profound implications and potential to address complex challenges. While I appreciate AI's practical applications, I'm particularly drawn to exploring its more advanced and theoretical aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm particularly interested by the far-reaching, almost sci-fi-like aspects of AI. My research aspirations revolve around complex topics such as machine sentience, the potential for superintelligence, the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and the implications of technological singularity. These concepts, which push the boundaries of current technology and scientific understanding, are what drive my passion for AI and fuel my academic pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through my roles as a Research Assistant, AI Engineer at BARBAH Games, and President of the UON AI Society, I'm constantly seeking ways to explore these advanced concepts while also making AI more accessible and understandable to others. Whether I'm working on AI literacy projects, developing chatbots, or evaluating AI content quality, I'm always considering how these efforts might contribute to our understanding of AI's ultimate potential and its impact on humanity's future.

                    As a key member of the Study Smart project, funded by the UON Learning Enhancement and Innovation Fund, I'm deeply involved in groundbreaking research on AI applications in education. Our focus is on enhancing independent learning and revision among students through innovative AI-driven solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role involves conducting in-depth research, data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using tools like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. This work is crucial in identifying trends that contribute to current and future educational strategies within the university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant part of my work centers on AI literacy enhancement. I deliver comprehensive workshops and presentations to both faculty and students, facilitating effective knowledge sharing about AI in education. Our project's impact was recognized when we presented at three conferences, highlighting our outstanding contribution to AI in education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also heavily involved in the technical aspects of our research, including prompt engineering and fine-tuning a customized GPT model. Through data analysis and output testing, I ensure accurate and desired results, leveraging my expertise in AI and machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I co-authored and presented our research, "Study Smart: Staff and students co-constructing AI literacy at UON," at the Merged Futures 6 conference on June 14, 2024. This county-level presentation showcased our team's collaborative efforts in advancing AI literacy within our academic community.
