        <p>Hi everyone!</p>

        <p>As we find ourselves in a world where AI is advancing at lightning speed, the challenge of choosing the right course of study becomes more crucial than ever. Inspired by Sam Altman's perspective that building for the future of AI means anticipating its continued improvement, I've been working on a project aimed at helping individuals make future-proof decisions about their education and careers.</p>

        <p>Personally, I've noticed a common theme from listening to numerous podcasts featuring CEOs of AI companies, top AI researchers, and industry leaders. They frequently emphasize the importance of becoming familiar with the tools, being adaptable, exploring fields like digital biology (as Jensen Huang mentions), and leveraging creativity. However, while their advice is valuable, it can sometimes be hard to decipher, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific course of study that aligns with these evolving demands.</p>

        <p>With a few of them being a bit more direct, like Dario Amodei's recent blog post <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-ceo-predicts-ai-utopia&_bhlid=a4dc3b489400332c063e8973e188c09611c75b10" target="_blank">(Machines of Loving Grace)</a>, there's often a focus on the interdisciplinary nature of AI, particularly in areas like biology, neuroscience, and economics. Dario talks about how AI will not only analyze data but eventually design experiments and direct research. This suggests that learning AI alone isn't enough; you need to integrate it into broader fields like genetic research, bioinformatics, and neuroscience to truly unlock its potential.</p>

        <p>And indeed, these are topics I still find hard to decipher, because it's not something you can learn in a typical school setting. Most of these areas require intent, self-study, and a drive to integrate AI into futuristic fields. Sam Altman often talks about the importance of staying ahead by assuming AI will continually improve, and this forms the core of my project.</p>

        <p>That's where my project comes in. I'm developing a solution that guides users through the process of choosing a course of study based on these insights and AI advancements, scaling laws, and reasoning breakthroughs. It's a tool designed to help people align their interests with forward-thinking fields that will remain relevant as AI systems become more sophisticated. Think AI in Mars research, interstellar travel, neurobiology, and even superintelligence research. These are fields that are not only exciting but also have long-term potential as we build more capable AI systems.</p>

        <p>By using this tool, users will be able to map out courses and areas of study that will set them up for success in an AI-driven future. I believe that by choosing something futuristic and specific, like AI in space exploration or sentient AI research, we can stay ahead of the curve and build careers that remain indispensable as AI evolves.</p>

        <p>Expect to see a rough solution in the next week or two, and I can't wait to share this with you! Stay tuned for more updates, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this exciting journey.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Cheers,<br>Ryan</p>
