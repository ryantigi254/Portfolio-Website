            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Neurodivergent children, particularly those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and sensory processing disorders (SPD), experience significant distress due to sensory dysregulation. This distress presents as sensory hyper-responsivity, hypo-responsivity, or sensory-seeking behaviors, leading to challenges in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social interaction and communication</li>
                <li>Emotional regulation and anxiety management</li>
                <li>Academic performance and learning</li>
                <li>Daily functioning and independence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Traditional interventions like occupational therapy or static sensory tools (e.g., noise-cancelling headphones) fail to address these sensory triggers in dynamic, real-world environments, creating a critical gap in support for these children and their families.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                SensoryNeural represents our vision for an adaptive environment that supports neurodivergent children's sensory needs. By combining artificial intelligence with everyday surroundings, we aim to create spaces that adjust to the child rather than requiring the child to adjust to rigid environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach shifts from reactive interventions to proactive support, leveraging emerging technologies to predict and address sensory challenges before they lead to distress. The goal is to empower neurodivergent children with greater autonomy, inclusion, and overall well-being.
            </p>
            
            <div class="vision-box">
                <p><strong>Our ultimate vision is to shape an inclusive future where neurodivergent children have the same opportunities to thrive as their neurotypical peers.</strong></p>
